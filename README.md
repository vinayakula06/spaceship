# Spaceship Titanic - Machine Learning Project

This project addresses the Kaggle [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) competition, aiming to predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during their interstellar journey. The dataset includes various attributes of the passengers, such as their age, spending in different facilities, and other personal details.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform a full machine learning workflow:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration** - Understanding the dataset, its structure, and any missing values.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Cleaning data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Creating and selecting relevant features for the model.
4. **Model Training** - Building and evaluating multiple machine learning models to predict the target variable.
5. **Prediction** - Generating predictions for the test set and creating a submission file.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:
- `train.csv`: Training data with features and the target variable `Transported`.
- `test.csv`: Test data with features only (no target variable).
- `sample_submission.csv`: Template for submission.

**Key Columns**:
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- `HomePlanet`: The planet from which the passenger departed.
- `CryoSleep`: Indicates if the passenger elected to be put in cryosleep for the journey.
- `Cabin`: Cabin information.
- `Destination`: Intended destination.
- `RoomService`, `FoodCourt`, `ShoppingMall`, `Spa`, `VRDeck`: Expenses on various onboard services.
- `Transported`: Target variable (1 if transported, 0 otherwise).

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are used in this notebook:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

To install these libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spaceship-titanic.git
cd spaceship-titanic
```

### 2. Run the notebook

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook spaceship.ipynb
```

### 3. Explore the Data

In the initial cells, the code reads the data files and provides a summary of the dataset. We then explore data types, missing values, and data distributions.

### 4. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are imputed or filled appropriately.
- **Encoding**: Categorical variables are encoded to be usable for machine learning models.
- **Scaling**: Numeric columns are scaled to improve model performance.

### 5. Model Training

Multiple models are explored, including:
-KNN Model
-SVC Model

Each modelâ€™s performance is evaluated, and hyperparameters are tuned using cross-validation.

### 6. Prediction and Submission

Using the best-performing model, we generate predictions for the test set and create a submission file in the specified format.

## Results

The final model accuracy is provided in the notebook. This result may vary based on feature engineering and parameter tuning.
